Time.day,Day,Length of incubation ,Continuous numeric data,
Pred_T0.dens.ml,Individuals per mL,Density of Spathidium prior to incubation,0 or 5 individuals/mL,Whole numbers only
Pred_T24.dens.ml,Individuals per mL,Density of Spathidium after incubation,Continuous integers 0 - 23,Whole numbers only - as less than 1mL was counted decimals were rounded to whole numbers
Dexio_T0.dens.ml,Individuals per mL,Density of Dexiostoma prior to incubation,"Continuous numeric data, NA indicates that incubation was a CP experiment","In Para_Con and Para_FR treatments Dexiostoma was NOT present, but 0 prevent fitting so all true 0 are replaced by the integer 1"
Dexio_T24.dens.ml,Individuals per mL,Density of Dexiostoma after incubation,"Continuous numeric data, NA indicates that incubation was a CP experiment","In Para_Con and Para_FR treatments Dexiostoma was NOT present, but 0 prevent fitting so all true 0 are replaced by the integer 1"
Colp_T0.dens.ml,Individuals per mL,Density of Colpidium prior to incubation,"Continuous numeric data, NA indicates that incubation was a DP experiment","In Para_Con and Para_FR treatments Colpidium was NOT present, but 0 prevent fitting so all true 0 are replaced by the integer 1"
Colp_T24.dens.ml,Individuals per mL,Density of Colpidium after incubation,"Continuous numeric data, NA indicates that incubation was a DP experiment","In Para_Con and Para_FR treatments Dexiostoma was NOT present, but 0 prevent fitting so all true 0 are replaced by the integer 1"
